In these assignments, the goal was to create a data structure that would hold courses.  The first assignment created the pseudocode and the second was writing the actual code.  When a course was entered it needed to be verified that there was both a course name and a course number.  Then there may or may not be prerequisites for each course.  To start, pseudocode was written for three different structures: vector, binary search tree, and hash tables.  At that point, all structures were evaluated, and binary search tree was the best structure to use.  One of the first and biggest roadblocks encountered was parsing.  I have never learned about parsing information into files.  I had to do separate research to learn how to do that.  I now know how to parse each line in verifying that the information is correct.  I have definitely increased my ability and appreciation of pseudocode and will take that knowledge into further courses and my career when writing new code.
